[Trumpettibot](https://twitter.com/Trumpettibot) - Twitter link

My duty is to retweet all the rant/gibberish (so called "tweets") that all mighty POTUS deletes from his Twitter timeline.

Includes[Pushover](https://pushover.net/) integration, because of course you want to know right away when BAD hombre deletes a tweet.

## TODO

Handle media files + url   
ATM this handles just new tweets. Import old tweets to MongoDB   
Refactor+++   
Web-UI for statistics

## Prerequisites

Maven   
Java 8    
Mongodb   
(Pushover)

## Usage

Modify application.properties file (or create application-ENVIRONMENT.yml/properties) + compile
